# AI-Driven-Personal-Financial-Assistant

Use machine learning to create a personal financial plan for the user. 

## Description

This application’s primary purpose is to apply AI and machine learning models to provide users with the best personalized financial advice. The application will analyze a person’s financial data such as expenses, savings, and income, and offer a customized recommendation for budgeting, saving, investing, and managing debt. The front end will begin with a login page where the user must create an account if they have not already. Next, the user will be asked to submit any information about their current finances, like bank statements, credit card statements, or income statements. Next, we will utilize machine learning to categorize expenses and determine the user's spending patterns. Furthermore, the goal will also be to inform the user where the user can reduce expenses. The user will have the choice of picking the option of budgeting tool, saving recommendations, or debt management. The budgeting tool will set a budget for a category. For example, if the user exceeds the amount they should have spent on groceries an alert would be provided to the user about his current plan. The saving recommendation would be based on the user’s income and provide a plan on how much the user should spend or save. Based on the time limit I would also like to provide predictive Analytics. This is about predicting future financial scenarios and helping users make the best decisions. The biggest part of this application will be security. We will be dealing with some extremely sensitive documents. Therefore, security will be a huge part of this project.
